- can largely reuse paged() function 

in task 4, processes doe not need all pages to be allocated before it is allowed to execute

- A process can be exeuted if at least 4 pages are allocated. 
    or all pages incase of processes requiring less than 4 pages. 

    If there are more than 4 frames available at the time of allocation (or reallocation), the process manager
    must allocate as many pages as possible. 

        if there are not enought frames, pages of the least recently executed process needs 
        to be evicted one at a time unti there are 4 empty pages OR LESS if process requires less than 4 pages

        evict from lowest number first
        e.g. 1,5,7,9
            evict 1,5 if two frames needed. 


processManager file

    round robin scheduler determines process p, the next process to be allocated to the CPU 


        memoryManagement file 

            allocate memory function 
                check how many free frames there are,
                    if num_free_frames < 4 
                        evict_lru_pages - pass in how many frames are needed until there are 4 empty pages
                            keep evicting pages in processes until just the number of frames are needed
